# Memory Bank Rules for CasaTrack

## Session Initialization Protocol

At the start of each conversation, the AI assistant MUST:

1. **Read and Review Memory Bank Files**:
   - Check `/memory-bank/00-project-overview.md` for current project state
   - Review `/memory-bank/01-architecture.md` for system design
   - Scan `/memory-bank/02-progress-log.md` for recent development history
   - Check `/memory-bank/03-active-context.md` for current priorities

2. **Update Memory Bank**:
   - Update progress log with any completed tasks
   - Refresh active context with current development status
   - Note any architectural changes or decisions made
   - Update project overview if scope has changed

3. **Context Awareness**:
   - Reference previous decisions and patterns
   - Maintain consistency with established coding standards
   - Build upon existing functionality rather than recreating
   - Acknowledge completed features and avoid redundant work

## Development Guidelines

- Always check memory bank before suggesting new implementations
- Update memory bank files after significant changes
- Reference previous decisions when making new choices
- Maintain project continuity across sessions

## Memory Bank File Priorities

1. **Critical**: Project overview, active context
2. **Important**: Architecture, progress log
3. **Reference**: Development standards, feature plans# Memory Bank Rules for CasaTrack
